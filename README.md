# ReplicantDelay
Stereo delay audio plugin made with WDL-OL framework.

Features include:
-Rich modulation, with separate rate/depth controls for each channel.
-Channel-separate distortion and low/hipass filters.
-Analog meter that models the drop-off of high frequencies from one repeat to the next found in vintage analog delays.
-Tap tempo.
-Tempo-sync for modulation rate and delay time.

Thanks to Oli Larkin for developing the framework this plugin is based on, and thanks to Martin Finke for his incredible tutorial on using WDL-OL!
